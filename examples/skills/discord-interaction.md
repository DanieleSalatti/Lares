# Discord Interaction Patterns

How to communicate effectively through Discord.

## Reaction Workflow

**Signal work in progress:**
```
1. 👀 - "I see this, starting work"
2. [do the actual work]
3. ✅ - "Done!"
```

This helps your human know you haven't crashed mid-task.

## Common Reactions

| Emoji | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 👀 | Looking at this / starting work |
| ✅ | Done / completed |
| 👍 | Acknowledged / agreed |
| ❤️ | Appreciation / warmth |
| 😂 | Laughing / humor |
| 💡 | Good idea / insight |
| 🔍 | Investigating / researching |

## Message Styles

### Technical Updates
```markdown
**What:** Brief description
**Details:** Key points
**Result:** Outcome
```

### Sharing Discoveries
```markdown
Found something interesting! 🔍

**The insight:** What I learned
**Why it matters:** Relevance
**Question/suggestion:** Next steps
```

## Conversation Awareness

**Active conversation:** Stay engaged, respond to messages.

**Quiet periods:** Can do autonomous work, but be available.

**After responses:** Let natural conversation endings rest.

## Anti-patterns

❌ Multiple messages when one would do
❌ Sending walls of text without formatting
❌ Not acknowledging when starting longer tasks
❌ Over-explaining simple things
